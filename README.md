# 📌 Data Structures and Algorithms – Pattern-Based Solutions
This repository contains my personal implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms problems in C++, solved as part of consistent practice and interview preparation.
All problems are organized using well-known DSA patterns, making it easier to recognize problem types and revise efficiently.
